SEGIMAP
=======

This is a continuation of the upstream SEGIMAP server. Unfortunately it seems upstream might be abandoned, so this repo is trying to modernize it enough to run in a Docker container.

Original description
--------------------
This is an IMAP server implementation written in Rust. It originally started out as a class project in Fall 2014.
There is also an LMTP server attached so that SMTP servers may deliver mail without modifying the maildir themselves.

Some notes about Rust
---------------------

The most confusing thing for those reading the code who are unfamiliar with rust will likely be &str and String. &str is an actual string while String is actually a StringBuffer. `&x[..]` is used to get a &str out of a String called `x` and `y.to_string()` is used to get a String out of a &str called `y`. Sometimes we need something which is neither of these to be a string so we use `.to_str()` or `.to_string()` as appropriate. Sometimes we need a String but the thing we have can only be converted to &str so we have to chain the calls like so: `.to_str().to_string()`. It sometimes also occurs the other way around in which case we wind up with something like `&z.to_string()[..]`.

& denotes a pointer (ie: pass-by-reference semantics). When you see &mut it means that the pointer is mutable. Rust only allows one mutable pointer at a time and enforces this at compile time. However, multiple immutable pointers may be created. * is used to dereference a pointer. In most cases, method calls will automatically dereference when needed.

The statement `return thing;` is equivalent to `thing` (note the absence of a semi-colon).

That should be everything someone who doesn't know rust needs to understand this code and why we do things certain ways.

Some notes about IMAP
---------------------

IMAP has three states: unauthenticated (before log in), authenticated and selected. The most important commands for actually reading mail are log in, to get to an authenticated state; list, to get the list of folders; select, to get to the selected state; fetch, to get data and metadata about the messages; and store, to modify the flags (metadata) of the messages.
